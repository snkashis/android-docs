[Mapbox's demo app on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapbox.mapboxandroiddemo&hl=en) includes many examples of how to use the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android. The demo app and [the examples section of this documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/android-docs/maps/examples/) are great places to start for understanding the power of the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android.

## Install the Maps SDK

{{

    text="A step-by-step walkthrough to help you get started with Maps SDK for Android."
  />
}}

Before starting to develop your application with the Maps SDK, you'll need to add the SDK as a dependency. You can find the following dependency given below in the MavenCentral repository. Although this document shows you how to insert the stable version of the Maps SDK inside of your project, you can also use the nightly build (i.e. SNAPSHOT) or the beta version, if one is available. Find more information about how to do this inside the project’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master/platform/android/#readme).

If your application is close or exceeds the 65k method count limit, you can mitigate this problem by enabling ProGuard inside your application. ProGuard directives are included in the Android dependencies to preserve the required classes. You can also shrink the file APK file size by making use of APK splitting.

### 1. Add the dependency

1. Start Android Studio.
2. Open up your application's `build.gradle` file.
3. Make sure that your project's `minSdkVersion` is at API 14 or higher.
4. Under dependencies, add a new `implementation` dependency line for the latest `mapbox-android-sdk`.
5. Find the `File` in the toolbar and then clik on `Sync Project with Gradle Files`.

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.mapbox.mapboxsdk:mapbox-android-sdk:{{ MAP_SDK_VERSION }}'
}
```

_Note: You might have mismatching gradle dependencies once you add the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android. Don't forget that you can use `exclude group` like below, to remove certain dependencies:_

```
implementation ('com.mapbox.mapboxsdk:mapbox-android-sdk:{{ MAP_SDK_VERSION }}'){
    exclude group: 'group_name', module: 'module_name'
}
```
Additionally, running `gradle app_module_name_here:dependencies` in your command line will print a list of dependencies. `./gradlew app:dependencies` works if you have a Gradle wrapper. They are helpful for troubleshooting nimble Gradle configurations when various libraries are included in a single project. You can see the dependencies that specific libaries are bringing and where conflicts might be happening.

### 2. Get an access token

If you don't have a Mapbox account, sign up for one [here](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/), and then navigate to your [Account page](https://www.mapbox.com/account/). Copy your **default public token** to your clipboard. After you've added the Maps SDK as a dependency inside of your Android project, open the `R.strings.xml` file, create a new String resource, and paste the access token.

```xml
<string name="mapbox_access_token">PASTE_YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE</string>
```

Then to pass this into the Maps SDK, you'll want to place the access token inside of your application's `onCreate()` method.

{{
<CodeLanguageToggle id="token-in-application-class" />
<ToggleableCodeBlock

java={`
public class MyApplication extends Application {

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

    // Mapbox Access token
    Mapbox.getInstance(getApplicationContext(), getString(R.string.mapbox_access_token));
  }
}
`}

kotlin={`
class MapboxApplication : Application() {

	override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

    // Mapbox Access token
    Mapbox.getInstance(getApplicationContext(), getString(R.string.mapbox_access_token));
	}
}
`}

/>
}}

The Maps SDK also provides a `setToken()` method in case you want to switch the Mapbox access token at runtime. Certain Mapbox APIs require special Mapbox tokens, such as maps in China. Setting a new token enables use of multiple Mapbox tools in conjunction with one another. This method allows you to set a token immediately before a specific Mapbox tool is used instead of setting the token initially and being required to use the same token for all Mapbox-related requests.

{{
<CodeLanguageToggle id="switch-token" />
<ToggleableCodeBlock

java={`
Mapbox.setAccessToken(MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN)
`}

kotlin={`
Mapbox.setAccessToken(MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN)
`}

/>
}}


### 3. Setup permissions

Starting with the 5.0 version of the Maps SDK, we are making use of the Manifest merge feature to reduce the need to include any Maps SDK required things inside of your application's manifest file. You'll need to add _either_ the Fine **or** Coarse location permission if you plan to display a user's location on the map or get the user's location information. The user location permission should also be checked during runtime using the [PermissionManager](https://www.mapbox.com/android-docs/core/overview/#permissionsmanager).

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

### 4. Add a map

Open the Java file of the activity where you'd like to include the map in and add the code below to the file.

{{
<CodeLanguageToggle id="add-a-map" />
<ToggleableCodeBlock

java={`
private MapView mapView;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

  mapView = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.mapView);
  mapView.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  mapView.getMapAsync(new OnMapReadyCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onMapReady(MapboxMap mapboxMap) {

      // Customize map with markers, polylines, etc.

    }
  });
}
`}

kotlin={`
private var mapView: MapView? = null

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

	// Mapbox access token is configured here. This needs to be called either in your application
	// object or in the same activity which contains the mapview.
	Mapbox.getInstance(this, getString(R.string.access_token))

	// This contains the MapView in XML and needs to be called after the access token is configured.
	setContentView(R.layout.activity_basic_simple_mapview)

	mapView = findViewById(R.id.mapView)
	mapView?.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
	mapView?.getMapAsync {

	    // Customize map with markers, polylines, etc.


	}
}
`}

/>
}}

Open the acitvity's XML layout file and add the `mapView` within your layout.

```xml
<com.mapbox.mapboxsdk.maps.MapView
  android:id="@+id/mapView"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  mapbox:mapbox_styleUrl="@string/mapbox_style_mapbox_streets" />
```

### 5. Lifecycle methods

The `MapView` contains its own lifecycle methods for managing Android's OpenGL lifecycle, which must be called directly from the containing Activity. In order for your app to correctly call the MapView's lifecycle methods, you must override the following lifecycle methods in the Activity that contains the MapView and call the respective MapView method. For example, your onStart() method should look like this:

{{
<CodeLanguageToggle id="on-start" />
<ToggleableCodeBlock

java={`
@Override
protected void onStart() {
	super.onStart();
	mapView.onStart();
}
`}

kotlin={`
override fun onStart() {
	super.onStart()
	mapView?.onStart()
}
`}
/>
}}


All the lifecycle methods that need to be overridden:

{{
<CodeLanguageToggle id="lifecycle-methods" />
<ToggleableCodeBlock

java={`
onCreate();
onStart();
onResume();
onPause();
onStop();
onSaveInstanceState();
onLowMemory();
onDestroy();
`}

kotlin={`
onCreate();
onStart();
onResume();
onPause();
onStop();
onSaveInstanceState();
onLowMemory();
onDestroy();
`}
/>
}}


If you're using a fragment, call `mapview.onDestroy()` inside the fragment's `onDestroyView()` method rather than inside `onDestroy()`:

{{
<CodeLanguageToggle id="fragment-ondestroyview" />
<ToggleableCodeBlock

java={`
@Override
public void onDestroyView() {
	super.onDestroyView();

		mapView.onDestroy();

}
`}

kotlin={`
fun onDestroyView() {
	super.onDestroyView()

		mapView.onDestroy()

}
`}

/>
}}


### 6. Java 8

If you're using an Android Studio version that is `3.1.0` or above, you can ignore this section because the new dex compiler D8 will be enabled by default.

The Mapbox Maps SDK for Android introduces the use of Java 8. To fix any Java versioning issues, ensure that you are using Gradle version of 3.0 or greater. Once you’ve done that, add the following compileOptions to the `android` section of your app-level build.gradle file like so:

```
android {
  ...
  compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

This can also be done via your project settings (File > Project Structure > Your_Module > Source Compatibility / Target Compatibility).

## Attribution

<!-- {{
  <Floater
    url="https://www.mapbox.com/help/attribution/"
    title="Attribution guidelines"
    category="help"
    text="Learn more about what kinds of attribution Mapbox require and why."
  />
}} -->

You must include the Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice on any map that uses the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android. We provide an attribution layout that includes all required information and can be customized either in xml or using the `UiSettings` object.

You may adjust the position of the Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice, but they must stay visible on the map. You may also change the background and text color of the attribution notice to best match your design aesthetics, but all information must be legible.

You may not otherwise alter the Mapbox wordmark or text attribution notice. If you wish to move or to remove the Mapbox wordmark, please [contact our sales team](https://www.mapbox.com/contact/sales/) to discuss options available under our Enterprise plans.

## Telemetry opt out
Mapbox Telemetry is a [powerful location analytics platform](https://www.mapbox.com/telemetry/) included in this SDK. By default, anonymized location and usage data is sent to Mapbox whenever the host app causes it to be gathered. The [Mapbox Terms of Service](https://www.mapbox.com/tos/) require your app to provide users with a way to individually opt out of Mapbox Telemetry, which is provided automatically as part of the [attribution](#attribution) control. If you hide the attribution control, you must provide an alternative opt out for your users to use.

## MapView XML attributes

To further customize the map such as setting the starting camera position, style, or adjusting the UI, attributes can be added inside the XML `MapView`. All `MapView` XML attributes start with
`mapbox_` for identification and for removing any potential conflicts with other libraries.

Some examples of `MapView` attributes are:

```xml
<com.mapbox.mapboxsdk.maps.MapView
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraTargetLat="-36.84"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraTargetLng="174.76"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraZoom="10"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraBearing="34.33"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraTilt="50.25"
  mapbox:mapbox_styleUrl="@string/mapbox_style_satellite_streets"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraZoomMax="12.41"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraZoomMin="6"
  mapbox:mapbox_uiRotateGestures="false"/>
```

Due to the current implementation of Android Studio, you can't autogenerate `MapView` attributes by typing. You can always [view the full list of `MapView` attributes here](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/blob/master/platform/android/MapboxGLAndroidSDK/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml).
