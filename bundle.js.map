If you’d like to remove a particular marker, use <code>mapboxMap.removeMarker()</code> while passing in the marker object to be removed. If you would like to remove <em>all</em> markers, call the <code>mapboxMap.clear()</code> method. Note that this will also remove any polylines and polygons you’ve added to your map.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"customize-marker-icon\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#customize-marker-icon\\\"></a> Customize marker icon</h4>\\n<p>You can specify a custom icon by using the <code>IconFactory</code> object and passing it to the marker. The default marker icon’s used if you don’t specify an icon while creating your marker. The anchoring of the marker will be in the center, meaning if you have an icon with a point, you’ll need to add padding to the bottom of the image.</p>\\n<p>Place your custom marker image in your project’s drawable folder and note its file name. In the example below, the custom icon’s image file’s called <code>blue_marker.png</code></p>\\n<pre class=\\\"hljs\\\"><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Create an Icon object for the marker to use</span>\\nIconFactory iconFactory = IconFactory.getInstance(MainActivity.<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>);\\nIcon icon = iconFactory.fromResource(R.drawable.blue_marker);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Add the marker to the map</span>\\nmapboxMap.addMarker(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> MarkerViewOptions()\\n  .position(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> LatLng(-<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">37.821648</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">144.978594</span>))\\n  .icon(icon));\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"capturing-marker-events\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#capturing-marker-events\\\"></a> Capturing marker events</h4>\\n<p>The Maps SDK provides a handy listener for capturing when a user taps on a marker. By default, all markers come with an onMarkerClick event listener for displaying and hiding info windows. You can override this default event listener and set your own with the <code>setOnMarkerClickListener</code> method.</p>\\n<p>To display a toast message with the clicked marker’s title, listen for a click event with <code>setOnMarkerClickListener</code> and finally call <code>Toast.makeText()</code>. To prevent displaying a toast message and an info window at the same time, return true at the end:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"hljs\\\"><code>mapboxMap.setOnMarkerClickListener(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> MapboxMap.OnMarkerClickListener() {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">@Override</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">public</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">boolean</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">onMarkerClick</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(@NonNull Marker marker)</span> </span>{\\n    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>, marker.getTitle(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">true</span>;\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"update-a-marker\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#update-a-marker\\\"></a> Update a marker</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"fr flex-parent\\\">\\n  <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo/blob/master/MapboxAndroidDemo/src/main/java/com/mapbox/mapboxandroiddemo/examples/annotations/BasicMarkerViewActivity.java\\\" class=\\\"text-decoration-none flex-child--no-shrink mt6 color-blue-on-hover note-card flex-child-mxl\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"border round wmax360 border--gray-light flex-parent\\\">\\n      <div class=\\\"flex-child p12\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"txt-s txt-bold\\\">\\n          Animate marker\\n          <span class=\\\"txt-xs txt-bold align-middle px6 color-blue round bg-blue-faint\\\">EXAMPLE</span>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"txt-s mt3 mb0 color-gray\\\">\\n          Use a ValueAnimator to animate a marker between two positions.\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"flex-child flex-child--no-shrink w18 fr border-l border--gray-light flex-parent flex-parent--center-cross\\\">\\n        <svg class='flex-child align-middle icon--l'><use xlink:href='#icon-chevron-right'/></svg>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </a>\\n</div>\\n<p>If you have intentions to update a marker rather than completely removing it, the SDK provides a few update methods. Using these mean less boilerplate code and an increase in performance since you are only updating the marker. Using these update APIs, you can create animating markers using a <a href=\\\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/ValueAnimator.html\\\">ValueAnimator</a> for example. The APIs for updating either the marker position or icon bitmap are found inside of your marker object reference.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"hljs\\\"><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Change the marker location</span>\\nmarker.setPosition(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> LatLng(-<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">37.822884</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">144.981916</span>));\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Update the marker icon</span>\\nmarker.setIcon(icon);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3 id=\\\"info-window\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#info-window\\\"></a> Info Window</h3>\\n<p>Info windows are used to display information in a popup window anchored to a marker. Their default behavior is to appear when the marker is tapped and then show a title text view above a snippet text view. An info window gets created if you provide a given marker with either a title or a snippet of text. If you need to add an info window at a later time or need to update the title, for example, use <code>marker.setTitle()</code>.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"custom-view\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#custom-view\\\"></a> Custom view</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"fr flex-parent\\\">\\n  <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo/blob/master/MapboxAndroidDemo/src/main/java/com/mapbox/mapboxandroiddemo/examples/annotations/CustomInfoWindowActivity.java\\\" class=\\\"text-decoration-none flex-child--no-shrink mt6 color-blue-on-hover note-card flex-child-mxl\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"border round wmax360 border--gray-light flex-parent\\\">\\n      <div class=\\\"flex-child p18\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"txt-s txt-bold\\\">\\n          Custom info window\\n          <span class=\\\"txt-xs txt-bold align-middle px6 color-blue round bg-blue-faint\\\">EXAMPLE</span>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"txt-s mt3 mb0 color-gray\\\">\\n          Take advantage of the info window adapter to customize the info window.\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"flex-child flex-child--no-shrink w18 fr border-l border--gray-light flex-parent flex-parent--center-cross\\\">\\n        <svg class='flex-child align-middle icon--l'><use xlink:href='#icon-chevron-right'/></svg>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </a>\\n</div>\\n<p>The Maps SDK also provides an API to customize the contents and design of info windows. You’ll need to create an implementation of the <code>InfoWindowAdapter</code> and then call <code>MapboxMap.setInfoWindowAdapter()</code> and pass in your implementation as a parameter.  Inside the <code>InfoWindowAdapter</code>, a method called <code>getInfoWindow</code> gives the attached marker object and returns the info window view.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"polyline-and-polygons\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#polyline-and-polygons\\\"></a> Polyline and Polygons</h3>\\n<p>Adding a line or polygon to your map is like adding a marker. Due to the nature of these objects, different APIs are exposed, such as polygon color or line width.

The Maps SDK enables you to download and store pre-selected regions for usage when the device goes offline. The result of downloading the map is a fully functional map using your styles, tiles, and other resources inside the downloaded region.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"limitations\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#limitations\\\"></a> Limitations</h3>\\n<p>An app can download multiple regions for offline use, but the total offline download is capped at a maximum tile count “ceiling” across all downloaded regions. The tile ceiling is set to 6,000 tiles by default but can be raised <a href=\\\"https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/\\\">for paid plans</a>. Use our <a href=\\\"https://www.mapbox.com/labs/offline-estimator/\\\">Tile Count Estimator</a> to calculate the number of tiles required for your offline use case. Six thousand tiles cover a region roughly the size of Greater London within the M25 at zoom levels 0–15 or the contiguous United States at zoom levels 0–9. The size of these tiles on disk will vary according to the selected style.</p>\\n<p>The Maps SDK places no limit on the number of offline regions that may be created. Your Mapbox-powered application will reuse tiles and resources that are required by multiple regions, conserving network traffic and disk space.</p>\\n<p>The SDK also places no limit on the download speed of offline regions, nor to disk space used by offline resources. The limits will depend on the storage capacity of the mobile device and the speed of the network to which it is connected.</p>\\n<p>Our <a href=\\\"https://www.mapbox.com/tos/#%5BYmcMYmns%5D\\\">terms of service</a> do not allow you or an end user to redistribute offline maps downloaded from Mapbox servers.</p>\\n<p>The offline regions will update themselves to the latest data automatically while your user is connected to the internet.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"defining-a-region\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#defining-a-region\\\"></a> Defining a region</h3>\\n<p>Before a region can be used offline, the resources necessary for that region must be downloaded. Based on the parameters you specify when creating the region, the SDK calculates all resource requirements such as fonts, styles, and vector tiles covering the region. If more than one region in the offline database contains the fonts and styles, these will not be re-downloaded when another region’s downloaded.</p>\\n<p>First, you’ll need to get the <code>offlineManager</code> instance, define the region to download, and finally create the definition object. It’s important to note a few things:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The offline map style <em>must</em> match the one being used for your <code>mapView</code>.</li>\\n<li>The definition needs the device’s screen density. It’s best to get this from the activities resources.</li>\\n<li>The bounds used for the download must not go over the 6,000 tile limit.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre class=\\\"hljs\\\"><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Set up the OfflineManager</span>\\nofflineManager = OfflineManager.getInstance(SimpleOfflineMapActivity.<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Create a bounding box for the offline region</span>\\nLatLngBounds latLngBounds = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> LatLngBounds.Builder()\\n  .include(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> LatLng(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">37.7897</span>, -<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">119.5073</span>)) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Northeast</span>\\n  .include(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> LatLng(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">37.6744</span>, -<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">119.6815</span>)) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Southwest</span>\\n  .build();\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Define the offline region</span>\\nOfflineTilePyramidRegionDefinition definition = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> OfflineTilePyramidRegionDefinition(\\n  mapboxMap.getStyleUrl(),\\n  latLngBounds,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">10</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">20</span>,\\n  MainActivity.<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"metadata\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#metadata\\\"></a> Metadata</h4>\\n<p>Providing a metadata object’s encouraged with at least a region name so that various regions your user’s download will be distinguishable. Besides the region name, you can store any arbitrary binary region information you’d like. The contents are opaque to the SDK implementation and won’t affect your offline region download, it only stores and retrieves a byte array.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"hljs\\\"><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Implementation that uses JSON to store Yosemite National Park as the offline region name.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">byte</span>[] metadata;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">try</span> {\\n  JSONObject jsonObject = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> JSONObject();\\n  jsonObject.put(JSON_FIELD_REGION_NAME, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Yosemite National Park\\\"</span>);\\n  String json = jsonObject.toString();\\n  metadata = json.getBytes(JSON_CHARSET);\\n} <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">catch</span> (Exception exception) {\\n  Log.e(TAG, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Failed to encode metadata: \\\"</span> + exception.getMessage());\\n  metadata = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">null</span>;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Besides creating the metadata, you can also update the information stored, allowing your users, for example, to update the region name.

An access token isn’t needed if you plan to use Mapbox Java only for GeoJSON parsing or Turf calculations.

The order in which the coordinate pair are longitude followed by latitude. Creating a new Position is fairly straightforward and can be converted from a LatLng object if you are using our Maps SDK.</p>\\n<p>The SDK will try to detect if your coordinates are outside the excepted range and log a warning. This range is between -180 to 180 for longitudes and -90 to 90 for latitude.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you happen to be using our Maps SDK with this SDK, you’ll notice that the LatLng object has the reverse order, latitude comes before the longitude value.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Point will also be found in this SDK which is used specifically for GeoJSON objects. You can create a Point either directly from a Position object or passing in a longitude, latitude double array.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"hljs\\\"><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Position representing The White House</span>\\nPosition position = Position.fromCoordinates(-<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">77.03655</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">38.89770</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2 id=\\\"installation\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#installation\\\"></a> Installation</h2>\\n<p>To start developing your application using Mapbox Java, you’ll need to first decide which installation method works best for you.

High and Medium alert levels are only customizable, depart, arrival and low levels are all decided by other factors.

You can find the following dependency given below in the MavenCentral repository. While this document shows how to install the SDK through gradle, we also offer support for <a href=\\\"https://fabric.io/kits/android/mapbox/install\\\">Fabric</a>.</p>\\n<p>While we show how to insert the stable version of the SDK inside your project, you can also use the nightly build/snapshot or the beta version, if one is available. Find more information about how to do this inside the project’s <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master/platform/android/#readme\\\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\\n<p>If your application is close or exceeds the 65k method count limit, you can mitigate this problem by enabling ProGuard inside your application. ProGuard directives are included in the Android dependencies to preserve the required classes. You can also shrink the file APK file size by making use of APK splitting.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"1-add-the-dependency\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#1-add-the-dependency\\\"></a> 1.

After you’ve added the Map SDK as a dependency inside your Android project, open the <code>string.xml</code> file, create a new string, and paste the access token.

In order for your app to correctly call the MapView’s lifecycle methods, you must override the following lifecycle methods in the Activity that contains the MapView and call the respective MapView method. For example, your onStart() method should look like this:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"hljs\\\"><code><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">@Override</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">protected</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">void</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">onStart</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">super</span>.onStart();\\n  mapView.onStart();\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>All the lifecycle methods that need to be overridden:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"hljs\\\"><code>onCreate();\\nonStart();\\nonResume();\\nonPause();\\nonStop();\\nonSaveInstanceState();\\nonLowMemory();\\nonDestroy();\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3 id=\\\"attribution\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#attribution\\\"></a> Attribution</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"fr flex-parent\\\">\\n  <a href=\\\"https://www.mapbox.com/help/attribution/\\\" class=\\\"text-decoration-none flex-child--no-shrink mt6 color-blue-on-hover note-card flex-child-mxl\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"border round wmax360 border--gray-light flex-parent\\\">\\n      <div class=\\\"flex-child p12\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"txt-s txt-bold\\\">\\n          Attribution guidelines\\n          <span class=\\\"txt-xs txt-bold align-middle px6 color-green round bg-green-faint\\\">HELP</span>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"txt-s mt3 mb0 color-gray\\\">\\n          Learn more about what kinds of attribution Mapbox require and why.\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"flex-child flex-child--no-shrink w18 fr border-l border--gray-light flex-parent flex-parent--center-cross\\\">\\n        <svg class='flex-child align-middle icon--l'><use xlink:href='#icon-chevron-right'/></svg>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </a>\\n</div>\\n<p>You must include the Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice on any map that uses the Mapbox Map SDK. We provide an Attribution layout that includes all required information and can be customized either in xml or using the <code>UiSettings</code> object.</p>\\n<p>You may adjust the position of the Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice, but they must stay visible on the map. You may also change the background and text color of the attribution notice to best match your design aesthetics, but all information must be  legible.</p>\\n<p>You may not otherwise alter the Mapbox wordmark or text attribution notice.

The SDK comes with a default marker icon which can be configured to fit your specific needs. APIs are exposed to optionally change this icon to any bitmap image you wish. To create a marker for you map, you are only required to provide a <code>LatLng</code> position which defines where the marker will be placed on the map.

If you’d like to remove a particular marker, use <code>mapboxMap.removeMarker()</code> while passing in the marker object to be removed. If you would like to remove <em>all</em> markers, call the <code>mapboxMap.clear()</code> method.

The Maps SDK enables you to download and store pre-selected regions for usage when the device goes offline. The result of downloading the map is a fully functional map using your styles, tiles, and other resources inside the downloaded region.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"limitations\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#limitations\\\"></a> Limitations</h3>\\n<p>An app can download multiple regions for offline use, but the total offline download is capped at a maximum tile count “ceiling” across all downloaded regions. The tile ceiling is set to 6,000 tiles by default but can be raised <a href=\\\"https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/\\\">for paid plans</a>. Use our <a href=\\\"https://www.mapbox.com/labs/offline-estimator/\\\">Tile Count Estimator</a> to calculate the number of tiles required for your offline use case. Six thousand tiles cover a region roughly the size of Greater London within the M25 at zoom levels 0–15 or the contiguous United States at zoom levels 0–9. The size of these tiles on disk will vary according to the selected style.</p>\\n<p>The Maps SDK places no limit on the number of offline regions that may be created. Your Mapbox-powered application will reuse tiles and resources that are required by multiple regions, conserving network traffic and disk space.</p>\\n<p>The SDK also places no limit on the download speed of offline regions, nor to disk space used by offline resources. The limits will depend on the storage capacity of the mobile device and the speed of the network to which it is connected.</p>\\n<p>Our <a href=\\\"https://www.mapbox.com/tos/#%5BYmcMYmns%5D\\\">terms of service</a> do not allow you or an end user to redistribute offline maps downloaded from Mapbox servers.</p>\\n<p>The offline regions will update themselves to the latest data automatically while your user is connected to the internet.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"defining-a-region\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#defining-a-region\\\"></a> Defining a region</h3>\\n<p>Before a region can be used offline, the resources necessary for that region must be downloaded. Based on the parameters you specify when creating the region, the SDK calculates all resource requirements such as fonts, styles, and vector tiles covering the region. If more than one region in the offline database contains the fonts and styles, these will not be re-downloaded when another region’s downloaded.</p>\\n<p>First, you’ll need to get the <code>offlineManager</code> instance, define the region to download, and finally create the definition object. It’s important to note a few things:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The offline map style <em>must</em> match the one being used for your <code>mapView</code>.</li>\\n<li>The definition needs the device’s screen density.

Besides the region name, you can store any arbitrary binary region information you’d like. The contents are opaque to the SDK implementation and won’t affect your offline region download, it only stores and retrieves a byte array.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"hljs\\\"><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Implementation that uses JSON to store Yosemite National Park as the offline region name.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">byte</span>[] metadata;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">try</span> {\\n  JSONObject jsonObject = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> JSONObject();\\n  jsonObject.put(JSON_FIELD_REGION_NAME, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Yosemite National Park\\\"</span>);\\n  String json = jsonObject.toString();\\n  metadata = json.getBytes(JSON_CHARSET);\\n} <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">catch</span> (Exception exception) {\\n  Log.e(TAG, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Failed to encode metadata: \\\"</span> + exception.getMessage());\\n  metadata = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">null</span>;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Besides creating the metadata, you can also update the information stored, allowing your users, for example, to update the region name.

Layers refer to a source and give it a visual representation.</p>\\n<p>When creating a new source, two parameters are required, a source ID (String) and the source date.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"vector\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#vector\\\"></a> Vector</h4>\\n<p>Vector source tiles must be in <a href=\\\"https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/\\\">Mapbox Vector Tile format</a>.

The order in which the coordinate pair are longitude followed by latitude. Creating a new Position is fairly straightforward and can be converted from a LatLng object if you are using our Maps SDK.</p>\\n<p>The SDK will try to detect if your coordinates are outside the excepted range and log a warning. This range is between -180 to 180 for longitudes and -90 to 90 for latitude.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you happen to be using our Maps SDK with this SDK, you’ll notice that the LatLng object has the reverse order, latitude comes before the longitude value.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Point will also be found in this SDK which is used specifically for GeoJSON objects.

For example, one response might contain a full address while another response will only contain the city and country.</p>\\n<p>It’s recommended to first read over <a href=\\\"https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#geocoding\\\">the general geocoding API</a> documentation because not all available parameters are listed here.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you have included to correct permissions inside your AndroidManifest if you plan to use this API inside an Android application.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3 id=\\\"geocoding-request\\\"><a class=\\\"markdownIt-Anchor\\\" href=\\\"#geocoding-request\\\"></a> Geocoding request</h3>\\n<p>Before making the geocoding request, you must build the MapboxGeocoding object passing in two required parameters; a valid Mapbox <a href=\\\"#access-token\\\">access token</a> and a location/query (typically an address or description).

Instead of supplying the builder with a string address you’d pass in coordinates instead. Handling the response is like forward geocoding.

For example, one might be the street name while another result will be the country.

A boolean value is given, which you can use to write an if statement. Both cases should be handled correctly. Continue with your permission sensitive logic if the user approves.
