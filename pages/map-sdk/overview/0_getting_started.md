### Overview

The Mapbox Map SDK is an open source toolset for displaying maps inside of your Android application. [Mapbox's demo app on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapbox.mapboxandroiddemo&hl=en) includes many examples of how to use Mapbox Maps. Various pages in this documentation reference examples in the demo app.

### Install the Map SDK

Before starting to develop your application with the Map SDK, you'll need to add the SDK as a dependency. You can find the following dependency given below in the MavenCentral repository. While this document shows how to install the SDK through gradle, we also offer support for [Fabric](https://fabric.io/kits/android/mapbox/install).

While we show how to insert the stable version of the SDK inside your project, you can also use the nightly build/snapshot or the beta version, if one is available. Find more information about how to do this inside the projects [Github repo](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master/platform/android/#readme).

If your application is close or exceeds the 65k method count limit, you can mitigate this problem by enabling ProGuard inside your application. ProGuard directives are included in the Android dependencies to preserve the required classes. In addition, you can also shrink the file APK file size by making use of APK splitting.

#### 1. Add the dependency

1. Start Android Studio
2. Open up your application's `build.gradle`
3. Make sure that your project's `minSdkVersion` is at API 15 or higher
4. Under dependencies, add a new build rule for the latest `mapbox-android-sdk`
5. Click the Sync Project with Gradle Files near the toolbar in Studio.

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  compile ('com.mapbox.mapboxsdk:mapbox-android-sdk:{mapSdkVersion}@aar'){
      transitive=true
  }
}
```

#### 2. Get an access token

If you don't have a Mapbox account, sign up for one [here](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/), then navigate to the [token page](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/) in Mapbox Studio and copy your **default public token** to your clipboard. After you've added the Map SDK as a dependency inside your Android project, open the `string.xml` file, create a new string, and paste the access token. Then to pass this into the Map SDK, you'll want to place the access token inside of your application's `onCreate()` method.

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

    // Mapbox Access token
    Mapbox.getInstance(getApplicationContext(), "<your access token>");
  }
}
```

#### 3. Setup permissions
Starting in 5.0, we are making use of the Manifest merge feature to reduce the need to include any Maps SDK required things inside of your application's manifest file. You'll need to add _either_ the Fine **or** Coarse location permission if you plan to display a user's location on the map or get the user's location information. The user location permission should also be checked during runtime using the PermissionManager.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

#### 4. Add a map

Open the activity Java file you'd like to include the map in and add the code below to the file.

```java
private MapView mapView;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

  mapView = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.mapView);
  mapView.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  mapView.getMapAsync(new OnMapReadyCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onMapReady(MapboxMap mapboxMap) {

      // Customize map with markers, polylines, etc.

    }
  });
}

  // Add required Lifecycle methods listed in next section
```

Open the acitvities layout file and add the map view within your layout.

```xml
<com.mapbox.mapboxsdk.maps.MapView
  android:id="@+id/mapView"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  mapbox:mapbox_styleUrl="@string/mapbox_style_mapbox_streets" />
```

#### 5. Lifecycle methods
The MapView contains its own lifecycle methods for managing Android's OpenGL lifecycle, which must be called directly from the containing Activity. In order for your app to correctly call the MapView's lifecycle methods, you must override the following lifecycle methods in the Activity that contains the MapView and call the respective MapView method. For example, your onStart() method should look like this:

```java
@Override
protected void onStart() {
  super.onStart();
  mapView.onStart();
}
```

All the lifecycle methods that need to be overridden:

```java
onCreate();
onStart();
onResume();
onPause();
onStop();
onSaveInstanceState();
onLowMemory();
onDestroy();
```

### Attribution

<div class="fr flex-parent">
  <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/help/attribution/" class="text-decoration-none flex-child--no-shrink mt6 color-blue-on-hover note-card flex-child-mxl">
    <div class="border round wmax360 border--gray-light flex-parent">
      <div class="flex-child p12">
        <div class="txt-s txt-bold">
          Attribution guidelines
          <span class="txt-xs txt-bold align-middle px6 color-green round bg-green-faint">HELP</span>
        </div>
        <div class="txt-s mt3 mb0 color-gray">
          Learn more about what kinds of attribution Mapbox require and why.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-child flex-child--no-shrink w18 fr border-l border--gray-light flex-parent flex-parent--center-cross">
        <svg class='flex-child align-middle icon--l'><use href='#icon-chevron-right'/></svg>
      </div>
    </div>
  </a>
</div>

You must include the Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice on any map that uses the Mapbox Map SDK. We provide an Attribution layout that includes all required information and can be customized either in xml or using the `UiSettings` object.

You may adjust the position of the Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice, but they must remain visible on the map. You may also change the background and text color of the attribution notice to best match your design aesthetics, but all information must be clearly legible.

You may not otherwise alter the Mapbox wordmark or text attribution notice. If you wish to relocate or to remove the Mapbox wordmark, please [contact our sales team](https://www.mapbox.com/contact/sales/) to discuss options available under our Enterprise plans.

### MapView XML Attributes

To further customize the map such as setting the starting camera position, style, or adjusting the UI, attributes can be added inside the xml map view. all `MapView` XML attributes start with
`mapbox_` for identification and for removing any potential conflicts with other libraries.

Some examples of `MapView` attributes are:

```xml
<com.mapbox.mapboxsdk.maps.MapView

  ...

  mapbox:mapbox_cameraTargetLat="-36.84"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraTargetLng="174.76"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraZoom="10"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraBearing="34.33"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraTilt="50.25"
  mapbox:mapbox_styleUrl="@string/mapbox_style_satellite_streets"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraZoomMax="12.41"
  mapbox:mapbox_cameraZoomMin="6"
  mapbox:mapbox_uiRotateGestures="false"/>
```

Due to the current implementation of Android Studio, you can't autogenerate `MapView` attributes by typing. You can always [view the full list of `MapView` attributes here](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/blob/master/platform/android/MapboxGLAndroidSDK/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml).
